/**
 * <p>
 * Welcome to the <i>Amazon Simple Queue Service API Reference</i>. This section describes who should read this guide,
 * how the guide is organized, and other resources related to the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon SQS offers reliable and scalable hosted queues for storing messages as they travel between computers. By using
 * Amazon SQS, you can move data between distributed components of your applications that perform different tasks
 * without losing messages or requiring each component to be always available.
