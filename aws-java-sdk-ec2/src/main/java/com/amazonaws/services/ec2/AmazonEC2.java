     * <p>
     * For Amazon EBS-backed instances, <a>CreateImage</a> creates and registers the AMI in a single request, so you
     * don't have to register the AMI yourself.
     * </p>
     * </note>
     * <p>
     * You can also use <code>RegisterImage</code> to create an Amazon EBS-backed Linux AMI from a snapshot of a root

     * <p>
     * Some Linux distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), use
     * the EC2 <code>billingProduct</code> code associated with an AMI to verify subscription status for package
     * updates. Creating an AMI from an EBS snapshot does not maintain this billing code, and subsequent instances
     * launched from such an AMI will not be able to connect to package update infrastructure.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Similarly, although you can create a Windows AMI from a snapshot, you can't successfully launch an instance from
     * the AMI.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To create Windows AMIs or to create AMIs for Linux operating systems that must retain AMI billing codes to work

     * </p>
