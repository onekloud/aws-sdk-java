/**
 * <p>
 * Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it easy
 * to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances. Amazon ECS lets you launch and stop
 * container-enabled applications with simple API calls, allows you to get the state of your cluster from a centralized
 * service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features like security groups, Amazon EBS volumes, and IAM
 * roles.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on your resource needs,
 * isolation policies, and availability requirements. Amazon EC2 Container Service eliminates the need for you to
 * operate your own cluster management and configuration management systems or worry about scaling your management
 * infrastructure.
